## Exercise 056

Java Iterator class can help you to iterate through every element in a collection. Here is a simple example:

In this problem you need to complete a method func. The method takes an ArrayList as input. In that ArrayList there is one or more integer numbers, then there is a special string "###", after that there are one or more other strings. A sample ArrayList may look like this:

### Sample Input

element[0]=>42 <br />
element[1]=>10 <br />
element[2]=>"###" <br />
element[3]=>"Hello" <br />
element[4]=>"Java" <br />

You have to modify the func method by editing at most 2 lines so that the code only prints the elements after the special string "###". For the sample above the output will be:

### Sample Output

**Hello** <br />
**Java**

**Note:** The stdin doesn't contain the string "###", it is added in the main method.

To restore the original code in the editor, click the top left icon on the editor and create a new buffer.
